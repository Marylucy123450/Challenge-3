# Flatdango

Flatiron Movie Theater is open for business! You will be building out an application, Flatdango, that allows a user to purchase movie tickets from the theater.


## Installing

- Fork and clone this repository.
- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Run `json-server --watch db.json` to start the backend.

## Core Deliverables

As a user, I can:

- See the first movie's details, including its **poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets** (the number of tickets left will need to be derived from the theater's capacity and the number of tickets sold)
- Buy a ticket for a movie. The number of tickets sold for that movie should be persisted, and I should be able to see the number of available tickets decreasing on the frontend.
- I should not be able to buy a ticket if the showing is sold out.
